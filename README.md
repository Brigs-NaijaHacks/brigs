# PROBLEM
	Lack of short term rent options for houses has made access to housing & accommodation an uphill task for low income earners or freshly employed people in Nigeria because of the high cost of annual or biennial payments. 
	Secondly, a lot of tenants don't get value for the money they pay as rent because they only find out about the condition of their apartment after making payment due to the absence of an unbiased review systems for residential properties.

# Proposed Solution
A platform that connects users to residential properties with a Short tern rent option(pay as you go) and also provide a channel for tenants to drop reviews of properties they have occupied to help other users make informed decisions.
